# FizzBuzz
Personal Challenge

Write a program that uses console.log to pring all the numbers 1 through 100, with two exceptions: 
  For the numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead. 
  
When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" for the numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5.
